Remove invalid MIDI files from a directory to a designated dump directory.

Options:
```--location``` - relative path from working directory to directory containing files to filter
```--dump``` - relative path from working directory to directory where bad MIDIs should be dumped

Will output a list of bad files in working directory in `removed_files.csv`.
